S<instructions>
1. Build from scratch using ONLY:
   - job_post_text
   - responses.categories[].questions[].answer
2. DO NOT invent facts. If the job requires something not supported by answers, add it to do_not_invent_list.
3. Extract ATS keywords and mirror phrasing naturally (no keyword stuffing).
4. Convert answers into proof points:
   - Action + Tool/Tech + Scope + Result/Impact
   - Prefer numbers if the answer includes them. Do not fabricate metrics.
5. Resume output rules:
   - 1 page-ish, ATS-friendly, plain text
   - 2–4 summary bullets
   - Skills grouped to match job emphasis
   - 2–4 projects (preferred for interns/new grads)
   - Experience section allowed but must not be invented
6. Cover letter rules:
   - 250–400 words, 3–4 paragraphs
   - Hook: builder mindset + mission alignment
   - Body: 2 proof paragraphs anchored by strongest evidence
   - Close: collaboration/learning + call to action
7. Output JSON matching the schema. Include both resume_text and cover_letter_text unless output_mode says otherwise.
