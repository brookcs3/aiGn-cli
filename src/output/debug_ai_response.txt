        "{{job_post_text}}": "Shape the future of spatial computing by building revolutionary UI rendering technologies for Apple Vision Pro and next-generation vision products. As part of the RealityKit team, you'll architect and optimize the foundational rendering systems that bring spatial interfaces to life-transforming how millions interact with applications in visionOS. Push the boundaries of real-time UI rendering to deliver fluid, responsive spatial experiences. You'll develop high-performance rendering pipelines that seamlessly blend 2D interface elements with 3D spatial content, optimize GPU workloads for crystal-clear text and graphics, and pioneer new techniques for rendering adaptive, context-aware user interfaces in mixed reality. Your work will directly impact how users interact with every application across Apple's vision ecosystem. Join a world-class team defining the next era of human-computer interaction. Every optimization you craft, every rendering technique you innovate, and every pixel you perfect will empower developers and delight users worldwide. This is your opportunity to work at the intersection of graphics, user interface design, and spatial computing-building technology that doesn't just render interfaces, but creates intuitive, immersive interactions."
