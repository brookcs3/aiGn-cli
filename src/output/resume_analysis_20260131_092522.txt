  "variable_name.{Algorithm: Expanded Definition Cameron Brooks WR 227 – Section # July 26, 2025 Definition (Audience 1: High School Seniors / Undecided University Students) An algorithm is a clear, step-by-step set of instructions that solves a specific problem or completes a task. Like a recipe ensures you get the same cookies every time if you follow it, an algorithm ensures a computer gets the same result when it follows the same steps with the same input. Key Properties • Unambiguous: Each step is precise—no guessing. • Finite: It ends. No endless loops (unless that’s the point). • Deterministic Output: Same input ⇒same output. How Algorithms Work Algorithms break a big task into manageable, ordered actions. Example: finding a book in a library: 1. Go to the correct subject section. 2. Locate the right shelf (alphabetical order). 3. Scan for the author’s last name. 4. Pull the book. Low-Context Visual: Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich Figure 1: A six-step flow showing: Step 1: Gather bread, peanut butter, jelly. Step 2: Open jars and grab a knife. Step 3: Spread peanut butter on one slice. Step 4: Spread jelly on the other slice. 1 }.type": "string",
