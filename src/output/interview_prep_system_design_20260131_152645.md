## Question 1: **Data Analysis with Python**  
**The Question:**  
"Design a Python script to analyze a dataset and generate a report."  

**What They're Looking For:**  
Evaluate the candidate's ability to plan, code, and communicate a solution. Focus on data handling, code structure, and readability.  

**Strong Answer Framework:**  
- Opening: "I will start by outlining the problem and the data analysis plan."  
- Body: "The script will read the dataset, process it, and generate a report using pandas."  
- Closing: "I will ensure the code is efficient and easy to maintain."  

**Common Pitfalls:**  
- "Not using libraries like pandas or NumPy."  
- "Missing data handling logic."  
- "Not explaining the code's purpose."  

## Question 2: **React Web App Design**  
**The Question:**  
"Create a web application using React that displays a list of items."  

**What They're Looking For:**  
Evaluate the candidate's understanding of UI components, state management, and performance.  

**Strong Answer Framework:**  
- Opening: "I will start by defining the problem and the UI structure."  
- Body: "The application will have a list component that displays items with a button to add them."  
- Closing: "I will ensure the code is responsive and efficient."  

**Common Pitfalls:**  
- "Not using state management for dynamic UI elements."  
- "Not considering performance in large datasets."  
- "Not organizing the code logically."  

## Question 3: **SQL Joins in Data Analysis**  
**The Question:**  
"Design a SQL query to join two datasets and retrieve a summary of sales data."  

**What They're Looking For:**  
Evaluate the candidate's understanding of SQL joins, normalization, and performance.  

**Strong Answer Framework:**  
- Opening: "I will start by outlining the problem and the SQL query plan."  
- Body: "The query will join sales data from two tables and calculate the total sales."  
- Closing: "I will ensure the query is efficient and handles large datasets."  

**Common Pitfalls:**  
- "Not using proper SQL joins for complex data."  
- "Not optimizing the query for large datasets."  
- "Not understanding normalization principles."  

## Question 4: **Data Structures in Python**  
**The Question:**  
"Design a Python script to organize and store data using lists and dictionaries."  

**What They're Looking For:**  
Evaluate the candidate's ability to plan, code, and communicate a solution.  

**Strong Answer Framework:**  
- Opening: "I will start by outlining the problem and the data structure plan."  
- Body: "The script will use a list to store data and a dictionary for dynamic storage."  
- Closing: "I will ensure the code is efficient and easy to maintain."  

**Common Pitfalls:**  
- "Not using lists or dictionaries for data storage."  
- "Not explaining the code's purpose."  
- "Not considering performance in large datasets."
